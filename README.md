Chat Bot
--------

Develop a software that converses with the user in natural language and provides assistance/advice in 
some limited domain such as travel and tourism, banking, auto sales or education counseling. The 
questions and answers should be text based. For a higher grade, you should attempt to incorporate 
training/machine learning (i.e. make the bot learn things on its own via user interaction) into the 
program. The design should be based on three tiers as follows: 

Natural Language Interface – Text based interface for questions and answers 

Inference Engine – software that maps questions to correct answers 

Database/Knowledge base – Static facts (e.g. “Thank you” maps to “You are welcome”, “Good morning” 
maps to “Good morning”) may be hard coded or stored on some data structure such as a hash map, but 
the facts that can change/update with time must be obtained from a database.  For example, when a user 
asks a “banking assistant” what types of accounts they have, the answer should be a list of accounts 
(current account, savings account, FD account etc) obtained from the database.
